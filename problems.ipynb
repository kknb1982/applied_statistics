    "## Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "Firstly, what is the the Lady Tasting Tea Problem. This comes from the \"Design of Experiments\" by Ronald A fisher and states a lady can work out from tasting a cup of tea she can tell if the milk was added to the cup first or after the tea. The experiment he designed was to create eight cups of tea, half made milk first and half made tea first, and presenting them in a random order to the taster. the taster has the experiment explained so knows that four are made milk first and four are tea first. \n",
    "\n",
    "the null hypothesis is that she can't tell the difference between the tea making methods. There is a good explanation of [null hypothesis here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/null-hypothesis/) if this concept is new to you. This iteration of the experiment will extend the number of cups of tea to twelve with eight made tea-first and four made milk-first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the needed tools\n",
    "To complete this task we are going to need to use some mathematical functions so import `math`. Documentation about `math` is available at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). We will also use `intertools` to [create iterator blocks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#module-itertools). "

The different orders of these digits are the permutations eg 1579, 1597, 9715...... The number of different ways of ordering these permutations is four factorial, often written as 4!.

Once a coaster is full it reduces the number of cups to choose from by one.
