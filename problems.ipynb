    "## Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "Firstly, what is the the Lady Tasting Tea Problem. This comes from the \"Design of Experiments\" by Ronald A fisher and states a lady can work out from tasting a cup of tea she can tell if the milk was added to the cup first or after the tea. The experiment he designed was to create eight cups of tea, half made milk first and half made tea first, and presenting them in a random order to the taster. the taster has the experiment explained so knows that four are made milk first and four are tea first. \n",
    "\n",
    "the null hypothesis is that she can't tell the difference between the tea making methods. There is a good explanation of [null hypothesis here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/null-hypothesis/) if this concept is new to you. This iteration of the experiment will extend the number of cups of tea to twelve with eight made tea-first and four made milk-first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the needed tools\n",
    "To complete this task we are going to need to use some mathematical functions so import `math`. Documentation about `math` is available at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)."

    "### Permutations and combinations\n",
    "Permutations are the different ways the elements can be ordered. For example, your colleague has told you the combination for the lock on the stationery cupboard, you remember the digits are 1, 5, 7, 9, but not the order. None of the digits were repeated. The different orders of these digits are the permutations eg 1579, 1597, 9715...... The number of different ways of ordering these permutations is four factorial, often written as 4!. This is calculated by 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. It's going to take a while to get that stationery!\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinations is a selection of a number of elements from the set. The order does not matter and the same element cannot be selected twice. If we take our stationery cuboard lock again adn all we know if no digit is repeated in the code, the how many cominations so we have? 1234, 1345, 1456 etc. The order does not matter in combinations.\n",

If we label each of the cups one to twelve and put out four coasters, the tester is asked to put the milk-first cups on the coasters. For example, cups 3,4,7,11 might be selected. the cups could be placed on the coasters in any order, so 3 4 7 11 is the same and 7 4 11 3. Once a coaster is full it reduces the number of cups to choose from by one. To calculate the number of ways ofe selecting our four cups from twelve is to mutiple the number of cups to choose from to fill each coaster. So for coaster A, there are 12 choice and coaster B 11 choices and so on."
