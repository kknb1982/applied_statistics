    "Firstly, what is the Lady Tasting Tea Problem? This comes from the [\"Design of Experiments\"](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.502684/page/n5/mode/2up) by Ronald A Fisher and states a lady can work out from tasting a cup of tea if the milk was added to the cup before or after the tea. The experiment he designed was to create eight cups of tea, half made milk first and half made tea first, and presenting them in a random order to the taster. The taster has the experiment explained so knows that four are made milk first and four are tea first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that she can't tell the difference between the tea making methods. There is a good explanation of [null hypothesis here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/null-hypothesis/).

For example, a colleague was told the combination for the lock on the stationery cupboard, the remembered digits are 1, 5, 7, 9, none of the digits were repeated, but the order can't be remembered. The different orders of these digits are the permutations eg 1579, 1597, 9715...... The number of different ways of ordering these permutations is four factorial, often written as 4!. This is calculated by 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. It's going to take a while to get that stationery! For this experiment we do not mind the order in which the cups of tea are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinations is a selection of a number of elements from the set. The order does not matter and the same element cannot be selected twice. If we take our stationery cupboard lock again and all we know if no digit is repeated in the code, but no-one knows any of the digits, there are a large number of combinations eg  1234, 1345, 1456 etc. The order does not matter in combinations.\n",

If we label each of the cups one to twelve and put out four coasters, the tester is asked to put the milk-first cups on the coasters. For example, cups 3,4,7,11 might be selected. The cups could be placed on the coasters in any order, so 3 4 7 11 is the same and 7 4 11 3. Once a coaster is full it reduces the number of cups to choose from by one. To calculate the number of ways of selecting four cups from twelve is to multiply the number of cups to choose from to fill each coaster. So for coaster A, there are 12 choice and coaster B 11 choices and so on, until all 4 coasters are filled."

How to calculate the p-value and its significance is well explained in [https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html) and we will be looking at this in more detail in the later problems. However, for the lady tasting experiment it is still unlikely that three cups are correctly identified as being made milk-first by chance, but it is over the normal 0.05 threshold, so to be confident that the null hypothesis is true we will still need to see all four cups correctly identified."

    "We can create a function for this equation that takes in the three parameters, $x$, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ to do the calculation. If you are not familiar with defining a function [w3 schools has a great resource](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp). To solve the equation we will need `numpy.sqrt`, [see the official documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html) and `numpy.pi`, $\\pi$[for pi](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html#numpy.pi) to calculate the normalisation constant. The result of this is then multiplied by the exponential part of the equation. Exponents can be calculated in python using [`numpy.exp`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html#numpy.exp). Exponents are well described in [https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/exponents/](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/exponents/).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the data. Standard deviation describes the spread of the data away from the mean. A low standard deviation means the values are relatively consistent and close to the mean. A high standard deviation mean the data points are more spread out. There is a helpful description of standard deviation at [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/standard-deviation-formula/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/standard-deviation-formula/). The mathematical formula for standard deviation is:\n",

This randomly generates data for a normal distribution in line with the given parameters. The documentation recommends that we should generate our own random number generator, but for now let's look at `numpy.random.normal`. The parameters are:\n",

    "### Generate a normal distribution of 10 data points, 100,000 times\n",
    "Now let's use `numpy.random.normal` to generate a normal distribution with 10 data points, 100,000 times. The [official documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html) for this function shows it takes three parameters loc, scale and size. Loc is the mean or centre of the distribution, scale is the standard deviation or spread of the data and size gives us the number of outputs. Creating these outputs mimics sampling a population. This is often the way surveys and medical trials work, by collecting an intensive data set from a small subset to make assumptions about a larger population. "

    "### Analysis of Results\n",
    "This plot indicates that the standard deviation using the population standard deviation has moved further away from the true standard deviation than when using `ddof=1`. It shows that the population standard deviation (ddof=0) consistently underestimates the true population standard deviation (σ = 1.0). The sample standard deviation (ddof=1) provides an less biased estimate much closer to the true value. This change is called bias. When the means are reviewed, the population standard deviation (ddof=0) is approximately 0.92, when the sample deviation is around 0.97 and the true deviation is 1.0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the two plots are very similar, but the population standard deviation is slightly skewed to the left and the data for the sample standard deviation is showing slightly higher variance."

In many studies we want to see if the intervention we have made has made a difference, for example does 15 minutes of yoga before school reduce the self-reported feeling of stress at bedtime. T-tests can be used to test the null hypothesis, that our intervention has no impact. When a test does not reject the null hypothesis even though it is false, this is called a type II error. Type I and type II errors are well explained [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-science/type-i-and-type-ii-errors/).

    "### How Type II rate changes with the difference in means\n",
    "When there is truly to difference in the means we correctly accept that there is no difference in the population means about 95% of the time. The remaining 5% are Type I errors (false positives) due to α = 0.05. At the other end of the scale when the mean difference is 1, there is a very low chance that the population means are the same and we should reject the null hypothesis. The larger the effect the easier it is to detect. What causes this, why does the type II error rate decrease with larger effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statistical sensitivity - larger differences create greater separation between the null and alternative distribution. If they were drawn on a chart there would be no or very little overlap. This makes it easier for the t-test to 'see' the difference.\n",
    "2. Signal to noise ratio - noise in this circumstance relates to the change happening by chance alone. As the effect size (d) decreases, the true difference (signal) becomes larger relative to the noise (random variation) improving detection.\n",
    "3. Test statistic size - the t-statistic is directly proportional to the size of the effect (d). Larger effects produce larger t-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing this effect is important in choosing the correct limits. For example in a clinical trial where you want to pick up small but import effects like an increase likelihood of a heart attack a mean difference of 0.3 or less may be used along with a small p-value. For quality control, where you are looking for large effects within a small sample a mean difference of greater than 0.8 may be used.\n"
