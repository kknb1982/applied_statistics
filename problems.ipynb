    "## Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea\n",
    "Firstly, what is the the Lady Tasting Tea Problem? This comes from the \"Design of Experiments\" by Ronald A Fisher and states a lady can work out from tasting a cup of tea if the milk was added to the cup before or after the tea. The experiment he designed was to create eight cups of tea, half made milk first and half made tea first, and presenting them in a random order to the taster. The taster has the experiment explained so knows that four are made milk first and four are tea first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that she can't tell the difference between the tea making methods. There is a good explanation of [null hypothesis here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maths/null-hypothesis/) if this concept is new to you. This iteration of the experiment will extend the number of cups of tea to twelve with eight made tea-first and four made milk-first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the needed tools\n",
    "To complete this task we are going to need to use some mathematical functions so import `math`. Documentation about `math` is available at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). We will also use `itertools` to [create iterator blocks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#module-itertools). We will used `random` to randomly select which cups will have the milk added first. The full description of `random` is available at [https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html). Later I use `numpy` to evaluate the number of unique selections. `Numpy` is an incredibly useful package for scientific computing the [user guide](https://numpy.org/doc/2.3/user/index.html#user) is incredibly useful. Once the experiment is run incrementally, `matplotlib.pyplot` can be used to plot the outcomes as described in the [user guide](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)."

For example, cups 3,4,7,11 might be selected. the cups could be placed on the coasters in any order, so 3 4 7 11 is the same and 7 4 11 3. Once a coaster is full it reduces the number of cups to choose from by one. To calculate the number of ways ofe selecting our four cups from twelve is to multiple the number of cups to choose from to fill each coaster.

How to calculate the p-value and its significance is well explained in [https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html) and we will be looking at this in more detail in the later problems. However, for the lady tasting experiment it is still unlikely that three cups are correctly identified as being made milk-first by chance, but it is over the normal 0.05 threshold, so to be confident that the null hypothesis is true we will still need to see all four cups correctly identified."
